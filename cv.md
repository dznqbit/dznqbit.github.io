Full-stack/mobile developer and tech lead. On a team, I value high-frequency communication across all domains: 
- decomposing complex features to many low-complexity user stories
- rapid and specific feedback on pull requests
- frequent pairing sessions – sometimes 5 minutes, other times 3 hours
- regular, focused meetings (e.g. Dev Chat, Retro, &c)
- designated Slack channel for meta-project goofiness

I've worked with a variety of team configurations and workflows. I have a lot of experience negotiating requirements, often as an ad hoc product manager. While I can approximate their job, I much prefer to work closely with a product manager, teasing apart ambiguity in order to eliminate risk, or at least identify it.

As an educator, I try to foster curiosity, as I consider it the most important attribute for developer growth. I espouse breadth over depth; while I think specialization is often inevitable, I don't believe someone's inexpertise should preclude them from picking up work, provided they have adequate direction to stay unblocked.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing music, building experimental tools with Arduinos/Raspberry Pis, running, and throwing the ball for my dog.
